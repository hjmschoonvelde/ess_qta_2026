# QTA Lab 02 Answers: String Operations and Inspecting the House of Commons Corpus


## Learning goals

In this lab, you will learn how to:

- use `stringr` to inspect and clean character data;
- use regular expressions to search for patterns in text;
- standardise messy metadata values;
- create a `quanteda` corpus from the House of Commons sample;
- inspect corpus metadata, subset documents, reshape documents, tokenize
  text, and inspect keywords in context;
- create, trim, visualise, and compare document-feature matrices.

The running example is the same House of Commons sample we used in
Lab 1. This sample contains 5,000 speech contributions from 1945 to
2025.

## Load packages

We will use `dplyr` for data manipulation, `stringr` for string
operations, `ggplot2` for plotting, and `quanteda` for corpus
operations. The `quanteda.textstats` and `quanteda.textplots` packages
add useful tools for inspecting features and plotting text objects.

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(quanteda)
library(quanteda.textstats)
library(quanteda.textplots)
```

## Read the House of Commons sample

``` r
data_path <- "Data/hc_sample_1945_2025.rds"

hoc <- readRDS(data_path)
```

Let us recreate the `year` variable from Lab 1.

``` r
hoc <- hoc |>
  mutate(year = as.integer(format(date, "%Y")))

hoc |>
  select(date, year, speaker, party, agenda, terms, text) |>
  head(5)
```

    1 In addition to discussions with a large number of individual merchants and merchant bankers, many meetings connected with our post-war trade have taken place between my Department and Export Groups, a number of which include merchants among their members. The Consultative Committee which advised my Department on its future practice and procedure included a merchant among its members, and I have invited a merchant to join the Overseas Trade Development Council.

## String operations

R stores text as character data. The House of Commons sample contains
several character variables, including `speaker`, `party`, `agenda`,
`text`, and `speech_url`.

Let us start with a small vector of agenda labels. These are useful for
learning string operations because parliamentary agenda labels are often
messy: they vary in capitalisation, contain repeated phrases, and
sometimes include bracketed contextual information.

``` r
agenda_labels <- hoc$agenda[1:8]

agenda_labels
```

    [1] "Export Trade"                             
    [2] "Fruit and Vegetables (Short Weight)"      
    [3] "BRITISH PRISONERS OF WAR, FAR EAST"       
    [4] "FIGHTING SERVICES (PAY)"                  
    [5] "ROYAL NAVY (GERMAN SUBMARINE WARFARE)"    
    [6] "TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING (SCOTLAND) BILL"
    [7] "WAR GRATUITIES"                           
    [8] "WATER BILL"                               

``` r
str(agenda_labels)
```

     chr [1:8] "Export Trade" "Fruit and Vegetables (Short Weight)" ...

The `stringr` package contains many useful functions for working with
character data. We will start with basic pattern matching.

### Extracting and locating patterns

`str_extract()` returns the first match to a pattern.

``` r
str_extract(agenda_labels, "Trade")
```

    [1] "Trade" NA      NA      NA      NA      NA      NA      NA     

``` r
str_extract(agenda_labels, "WAR")
```

    [1] NA    NA    "WAR" NA    "WAR" NA    "WAR" NA   

Pattern matching is case-sensitive by default. Compare the following:

``` r
str_extract(agenda_labels, "war")
```

    [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
str_extract(str_to_lower(agenda_labels), "war")
```

    [1] NA    NA    "war" NA    "war" NA    "war" NA   

`str_which()` returns the positions of strings that contain a match.

``` r
str_which(str_to_lower(agenda_labels), "war")
```

    [1] 3 5 7

``` r
str_which(str_to_lower(agenda_labels), "trade")
```

    [1] 1

`str_locate()` gives the start and end position of the first match
inside each string.

``` r
str_locate(str_to_lower(agenda_labels), "war")
```

         start end
    [1,]    NA  NA
    [2,]    NA  NA
    [3,]    22  24
    [4,]    NA  NA
    [5,]    30  32
    [6,]    NA  NA
    [7,]     1   3
    [8,]    NA  NA

`str_locate_all()` gives the positions of all matches.

``` r
str_locate_all(str_to_lower(agenda_labels), "war")
```

    [[1]]
         start end

    [[2]]
         start end

    [[3]]
         start end
    [1,]    22  24

    [[4]]
         start end

    [[5]]
         start end
    [1,]    30  32

    [[6]]
         start end

    [[7]]
         start end
    [1,]     1   3

    [[8]]
         start end

### Regular expressions

Regular expressions are a compact language for describing text patterns.
They are extremely useful for cleaning and searching text.

The expression `\\d` matches a digit. The expression `\\d+` matches one
or more digits.

We can see this with parliamentary URLs, which contain dates and
identifiers.

``` r
speech_urls <- hoc$speech_url[1:5]

speech_urls
```

    [1] "https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/written_answers/1945/jan/16/export-trade#S5CV0407P0_19450116_CWA_118"                      
    [2] "https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1945/jan/16/fruit-and-vegetables-short-weight#S5CV0407P0_19450116_HOC_181"

``` r
str_extract(speech_urls, "\\d")
```

    [1] "1" "1" "1" "1" "1"

``` r
str_extract(speech_urls, "\\d+")
```

    [1] "1945" "1945" "1945" "1945" "1945"

``` r
str_extract_all(speech_urls, "\\d+")
```

    [[1]]
    [1] "1945"     "16"       "5"        "0407"     "0"        "19450116" "118"     

    [[2]]
    [1] "1945"     "16"       "5"        "0407"     "0"        "19450116" "181"     

    [[3]]
    [1] "1945"     "24"       "5"        "0407"     "0"        "19450124" "14"      

    [[4]]
    [1] "1945"     "30"       "5"        "0407"     "0"        "19450130" "309"     

    [[5]]
    [1] "1945"     "31"       "5"        "0407"     "0"        "19450131" "91"      

The `+` means “one or more of the preceding pattern”. So `\\d+` collects
a whole run of digits rather than just the first digit.

We can also extract dates from the URLs. The pattern below searches for
four digits, followed by a slash, three lower-case letters, another
slash, and two digits.

``` r
str_extract(speech_urls, "\\d{4}/[a-z]{3}/\\d{2}")
```

    [1] "1945/jan/16" "1945/jan/16" "1945/jan/24" "1945/jan/30" "1945/jan/31"

Here are a few useful regex patterns:

- `[a-z]`: any lower-case letter;
- `[A-Z]`: any upper-case letter;
- `[A-Za-z]`: any upper-case or lower-case letter;
- `\\d`: any digit;
- `\\s`: any whitespace;
- `\\b`: a word boundary;
- `.`: any character;
- `\\.`: a literal full stop.

### Word boundaries

Word boundaries help us avoid accidental matches. For example, `war`
also appears inside longer words such as `towards`. The pattern
`\\bwar\\b` matches `war` as a separate word.

``` r
example_text <- c(
  "The war changed British politics.",
  "The committee moved towards a compromise.",
  "Post-war trade was discussed."
)

str_detect(str_to_lower(example_text), "war")
```

    [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE

``` r
str_detect(str_to_lower(example_text), "\\bwar\\b")
```

    [1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE

Notice that `post-war` still contains `war` after a hyphen. Hyphens are
treated as boundaries by this pattern. Whether that is desirable depends
on the research question.

### Replacing patterns

`str_replace()` replaces the first match. `str_replace_all()` replaces
every match.

``` r
str_replace(agenda_labels, "Trade", "TRADE")
```

    [1] "Export TRADE"                             
    [2] "Fruit and Vegetables (Short Weight)"      
    [3] "BRITISH PRISONERS OF WAR, FAR EAST"       
    [4] "FIGHTING SERVICES (PAY)"                  
    [5] "ROYAL NAVY (GERMAN SUBMARINE WARFARE)"    
    [6] "TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING (SCOTLAND) BILL"
    [7] "WAR GRATUITIES"                           
    [8] "WATER BILL"                               

``` r
str_replace_all(agenda_labels, "[aeiou]", "-")
```

    [1] "Exp-rt Tr-d-"                             
    [2] "Fr--t -nd V-g-t-bl-s (Sh-rt W--ght)"      
    [3] "BRITISH PRISONERS OF WAR, FAR EAST"       
    [4] "FIGHTING SERVICES (PAY)"                  
    [5] "ROYAL NAVY (GERMAN SUBMARINE WARFARE)"    
    [6] "TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING (SCOTLAND) BILL"
    [7] "WAR GRATUITIES"                           
    [8] "WATER BILL"                               

In real QTA work, replacement is often used to standardise metadata. For
example, the sample contains several versions of “Business of the
House”.

``` r
hoc |>
  filter(str_detect(str_to_lower(agenda), "business of the house")) |>
  count(agenda, sort = TRUE) |>
  head(10)
```

                                                                                                            agenda
    1                                                                                        BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE
    2                                                                                        Business of the House

    4                                                                         BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE (FINANCE BILL)
    5                                                                       Business Of The House [Defence Policy]

We can create a cleaned agenda variable by:

- converting to lower case;
- removing extra whitespace;
- changing title case variants into a common label;
- removing bracketed contextual information when we want a shorter
  label.

``` r
hoc <- hoc |>
  mutate(
    agenda_clean = agenda |>
      str_to_lower() |>
      str_squish() |>
      str_replace_all("\\s*\\[.*\\]", ""),
    agenda_clean = case_when(
      agenda_clean == "business of the house" ~ "Business of the House",
      agenda_clean == "points of order" ~ "Points of Order",
      agenda_clean == "topical questions" ~ "Topical Questions",
      str_detect(agenda_clean, "^engagements") ~ "Engagements",
      TRUE ~ str_to_title(agenda_clean)
    )
  )

hoc |>
  count(agenda_clean, sort = TRUE) |>
  head(15)
```

                                    agenda_clean   n
    1                                       <NA> 206
    2                      Business of the House 151
    3                                Engagements  81
    4                          Topical Questions  69
    5                               Finance Bill  18
    6                            Points of Order  15
    7                European Economic Community  14
    8                      Debate On The Address  12
    9  Budget Resolutions And Economic Situation  11
    10                          Northern Ireland  11
    11                          European Council   9
    12                                   Housing   9
    13                  Local Government Finance   9
    14                   National Health Service   9
    15                      Amendment Of The Law   8

This kind of cleaning is not neutral. For example, collapsing all labels
that start with `Engagements` into one category may be helpful for
descriptive plots, but it also removes detail. Cleaning choices should
be documented.

## Inspecting a corpus

So far we have worked with character vectors and data frames. The
`quanteda` package lets us create a corpus object. A corpus stores texts
and document-level metadata together.

``` r
hoc_corpus <- corpus(
  hoc,
  text_field = "text"
)
```

We can inspect the corpus using `summary()`.

``` r
summary(hoc_corpus, n = 10)
```

    Corpus consisting of 5000 documents, showing 10 documents:

    "In addition to discussions with a large number of individual merchants and merchant bankers, many meetings connected with our post-war trade have taken place between my Department and Export Groups, a number of which include merchants among their members. The Consultative Committee which advised my Department on its future practice and procedure included a merchant among its members, and I have invited a merchant to join the Overseas Trade Development Council." 

## Subsetting a corpus

We can subset a corpus using `corpus_subset()`. The following code keeps
Labour speeches since 2010.

``` r
labour_since_2010 <- corpus_subset(
  hoc_corpus,
  party == "Labour" & year >= 2010
)

ndoc(labour_since_2010)
```

    [1] 271

``` r
summary(labour_since_2010, n = 5)
```

    Corpus consisting of 271 documents, showing 5 documents:

We can also subset by string patterns in document variables. For
example, let us keep speeches with agenda labels related to Prime
Minister’s Questions.

``` r
engagements_corpus <- corpus_subset(
  hoc_corpus,
  agenda_clean == "Engagements"
)

ndoc(engagements_corpus)

## Reshaping a corpus

Sometimes we want a different unit of analysis. `corpus_reshape()` can
reshape documents into sentences or paragraphs. This is useful when
speech-level documents are too long for a coding task.

``` r
engagements_sentences <- corpus_reshape(
  engagements_corpus,
  to = "sentences"
)

ndoc(engagements_corpus)
```

    [1] 81

``` r
ndoc(engagements_sentences)
```

    [1] 364

In the reshaped corpus, each sentence is now treated as a document. This
is a major research design choice: changing the unit of analysis can
change the conclusions of an analysis.

``` r
as.character(engagements_sentences)[1:5]
```

                                                                                                                                                                                                                           text2238.1

                                                                                                                                                                                                 "With regard to what the right hon." 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           text2238.4 
                                                                                                                                   "Gentleman said about pensioners, I usually see delegations of pensioners in my own constituency." 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           text2238.5 
    "I stress that the Government have kept 413 the pension slightly ahead of the rise in the cost of living, and our first increase actually provided an additional amount to make up for the shortfall of the previous Government." 

As you can see, the third sentence finishies with the ‘right hon.’ This
is a common abbreviation for ‘right honourable’, which is often used in
parliamentary speech, but it also shows that sentence boundaries are not
always perfect. In this case, the abbreviation contains a full stop,
which is often used to identify sentence boundaries. So before
reshaping, it is important to consider whether the text contains
abbreviations or other punctuation that might interfere with sentence
detection.

## Tokenization and multiword expressions

Tokenization breaks text into smaller units such as words. We will
tokenize the House of Commons corpus and preserve a few multiword
expressions.

``` r
hoc_tokens <- tokens(
  hoc_corpus,
  remove_punct = TRUE,
  remove_symbols = TRUE,
  remove_numbers = FALSE
)
```

Some political concepts are multiword expressions. If we want
`Prime Minister` or `European Union` to be treated as phrases, we can
compound them.

``` r
hoc_tokens <- tokens_compound(
  hoc_tokens,
  pattern = phrase(c(
    "Prime Minister",
    "House of Commons",
    "European Union",
    "National Health Service"
  ))
)
```

Now we can inspect keywords in context using `kwic()`.

``` r
kwic(
  hoc_tokens,
  pattern = phrase("European_Union"),
  window = 8
) |>
  head(10)
```

    Keyword-in-context with 10 matches.

We can also inspect a single-word pattern.

``` r

## From tokens to a document-feature matrix

A document-feature matrix, or DFM, represents documents as rows and
features as columns. In most introductory QTA workflows, these features
are words or phrases. The cell values usually count how often each
feature appears in each document.

The previous section created tokens for KWIC inspection. Now we will
create a second tokens object for DFM construction. For this workflow we
lower-case the text and remove English stopwords. We keep
`padding = TRUE` at first because this helps when identifying
collocations.

``` r
hoc_tokens_dfm <- tokens(
  hoc_corpus,
  what = "word",
  remove_punct = TRUE,
  padding = TRUE,
  remove_symbols = TRUE,
  remove_numbers = FALSE,
  remove_url = TRUE,
  remove_separators = TRUE,
  split_hyphens = FALSE
) |>
  tokens_tolower() |>
  tokens_remove(stopwords("en"), padding = TRUE)
```

### Collocations

Collocations are words that occur together more often than we would
expect by chance. In parliamentary text, examples might include
`prime minister`, `European Union`, or `hon. member`.

``` r
hoc_collocations <- textstat_collocations(
  hoc_tokens_dfm,
  min_count = 10
) |>
  arrange(desc(lambda))

head(hoc_collocations, 20)
```

                 collocation count count_nested length   lambda         z
    975            hong kong    15            0      2 18.01655  8.936495

    306        raw materials    18            0      2 12.03436 22.646568

We can compound strong collocations so that they are treated as single
features.

``` r
hoc_collocation_phrases <- hoc_collocations |>
  filter(lambda > 10) |>
  pull(collocation) |>
  phrase()

hoc_tokens_dfm <- tokens_compound(
  hoc_tokens_dfm,
  pattern = hoc_collocation_phrases
)

hoc_tokens_dfm <- tokens_remove(hoc_tokens_dfm, "")
```

### Create a DFM

Let us create a DFM and group it by party. This means that each row of
the grouped DFM is a party, and each column is a feature.

``` r
hoc_dfm_party <- dfm(hoc_tokens_dfm)

hoc_dfm_party <- dfm_group(
  hoc_dfm_party,
  groups = docvars(hoc_dfm_party, "party")
)

dim(hoc_dfm_party)
```

    [1]    23 30640

The `topfeatures()` function shows the most common features.

``` r
topfeatures(hoc_dfm_party, 25)
```

           hon government      right     member        can     people        one 
          6569       3213       2780       2428       2423       2296       2288 
        friend   minister      house       made       many    members       time 
          2279       2049       2000       1600       1537       1515       1503 
          bill       said  gentleman        may       make  secretary        now 
          1484       1484       1372       1351       1343       1340       1322 
         state         mr         us        say 
          1314       1310       1247       1237 

Most words do not appear in most documents. For this reason, DFMs are
usually sparse. `quanteda` stores DFMs efficiently, but trimming rare
features still often makes analyses easier to inspect.

``` r
hoc_dfm_party_trimmed <- dfm_trim(
  hoc_dfm_party,
  min_termfreq = 10
)

dim(hoc_dfm_party)
```

    [1]    23 30640

``` r
dim(hoc_dfm_party_trimmed)
```

    [1]   23 5474

Trimming is not neutral. Rare words may be noise, but they may also be
substantively important.

### Visualise features

Wordclouds are a quick way to inspect frequent features. They are not
usually the best final visualisation for research, but they are useful
for a first look.

``` r
textplot_wordcloud(hoc_dfm_party_trimmed, max_words = 50)
```

![](Lab_Session_QTA_2_Answers_files/figure-commonmark/plot_wordcloud-1.png)

A frequency plot is often easier to read.

``` r
hoc_feature_frequency <- textstat_frequency(
  hoc_dfm_party_trimmed,
  n = 25
)

hoc_feature_frequency <- hoc_feature_frequency |>
  mutate(feature = reorder(feature, frequency))

ggplot(
  hoc_feature_frequency,
  aes(x = feature, y = frequency)
) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Most frequent features in the party-level DFM"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](Lab_Session_QTA_2_Answers_files/figure-commonmark/plot_feature_frequency-1.png)

### Compare parties using keyness

Keyness compares feature usage in a target group with feature usage in a
reference group. Here we inspect which features are relatively
distinctive of Conservative speeches compared with the other parties in
the sample.

``` r
conservative_keyness <- textstat_keyness(
  hoc_dfm_party_trimmed,
  target = docnames(hoc_dfm_party_trimmed) == "Conservative"
)

head(conservative_keyness, 20)
```

```

### Track a feature over time

We can also create a DFM grouped by year. Here we focus on Conservative
speeches and count how often the feature `economy` appears in each year.

``` r
hoc_dfm_year_conservative <- dfm(hoc_tokens_dfm)

hoc_dfm_year_conservative <- dfm_subset(
  hoc_dfm_year_conservative,
  party == "Conservative"
)

hoc_dfm_year_conservative <- dfm_group(
  hoc_dfm_year_conservative,
  groups = docvars(hoc_dfm_year_conservative, "year")
)

docvars(hoc_dfm_year_conservative, "economy") <- as.numeric(
  hoc_dfm_year_conservative[, "economy"]
)

economy_by_year <- docvars(hoc_dfm_year_conservative)

ggplot(economy_by_year, aes(x = as.integer(year), y = economy)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = "Frequency of 'economy'",
    title = "Conservative mentions of economy in the teaching sample"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](Lab_Session_QTA_2_Answers_files/figure-commonmark/conservative_economy_by_year-1.png)

## Practice exercises

1.  Create a character vector called `speaker_names` that contains the
    first 20 speaker names in `hoc`. Use `str_detect()` to identify
    which contain `Sir`.

``` r
speaker_names <- hoc$speaker[1:20]

speaker_names
```

2.  Use `str_extract_all()` to extract all four-digit years from the
    first 20 `speech_url` values.

``` r
speech_urls_20 <- hoc$speech_url[1:20]

str_extract_all(speech_urls_20, "\\b\\d{4}\\b")
```

3.  Create a new variable called `mentions_prime_minister` that detects
    the phrase `Prime Minister` in the speech text. How many speeches
    mention this phrase?

``` r
hoc <- hoc |>
  mutate(
    mentions_prime_minister = str_detect(
      str_to_lower(text),
      "\\bprime minister\\b"
    )
  )

sum(hoc$mentions_prime_minister)
```

    [1] 279

4.  Use `corpus_subset()` to create a corpus of Conservative speeches
    from 2016 onwards. How many documents does this corpus contain?

``` r
conservative_since_2016 <- corpus_subset(
  hoc_corpus,
  party == "Conservative" & year >= 2016
)

ndoc(conservative_since_2016)
```

    [1] 368

``` r
summary(conservative_since_2016, n = 5)
```

    Corpus consisting of 368 documents, showing 5 documents:

5.  Reshape the Conservative corpus from exercise 4 to sentences. How
    many sentence-level documents does it contain?

``` r
conservative_sentences <- corpus_reshape(

9.  Create a DFM from `hoc_tokens_dfm` and group it by `party`. Call the
    result `hoc_dfm_exercise`. How many documents and features does it
    have?

``` r
hoc_dfm_exercise <- dfm(hoc_tokens_dfm)

hoc_dfm_exercise <- dfm_group(
  hoc_dfm_exercise,
  groups = docvars(hoc_dfm_exercise, "party")
)

dim(hoc_dfm_exercise)
```

    [1]    23 30640

``` r
topfeatures(hoc_dfm_exercise, 20)
```

           hon government      right     member        can     people        one

10. Trim `hoc_dfm_exercise` so that it only contains features that
    appear at least 20 times. Inspect the new dimensions.

``` r
hoc_dfm_exercise_trimmed <- dfm_trim(
  hoc_dfm_exercise,
  min_termfreq = 20
)

dim(hoc_dfm_exercise)
```

    [1]    23 30640

``` r
dim(hoc_dfm_exercise_trimmed)
```

    [1]   23 3424

11. Use `textstat_keyness()` to display the most distinctive features
    for Labour speeches compared with all other parties.

``` r
labour_keyness <- textstat_keyness(
  hoc_dfm_exercise_trimmed,
  target = docnames(hoc_dfm_exercise_trimmed) == "Labour"
)

head(labour_keyness, 10)
```
